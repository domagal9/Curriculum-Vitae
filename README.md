### SUMMARY
Mathematician skilled in data science, social network analysis, graph theory, and combinatorics. Passionate about using data analysis to drive storytelling by translating data and algorithms into meaningful insights for the public. Successful projects in classification, forecasting, network analysis, and data visualization. Looking for opportunities to use analytical skills and creatively problem solve in a collaborative environment with both other scientists and business stakeholders.

### EXPERIENCE
**The Backbone of a Weighted Graph 	2018 - 2021**
* Designed methods for finding statistically significant edges of weighted graphs, assisting researchers in identifying and predicting important relationships within their datasets. Models allow significant edges to be inferred from bipartite datasets, where true relationships between individuals may be difficult to determine.
* Implemented new and existing network models in the R package backbone, which has been downloaded over 15,000 times and is actively used by researchers in social network science, ecology, and geography fields.
* Led professional workshop on backbone to scientists from 13 different countries.
* This research is funded by Natural Science Foundation Grants #1851625 and #2016320.

* https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13396

**Permutation Statistics and Patterns 	2020 - 2021**
* Cyclic pattern avoidance – found and proved the number of permutations that avoid different combinations of length four cyclic patterns, proved a cyclic version of the Erdős-Szekeres theorem, found the generating functions for cyclic descents over certain avoidance sets. https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02534
* Pinnacle sets – proved a bijection between admissible pinnacle sets and ballot numbers, found new faster algorithms for counting the number of permutations with a given pinnacle set. https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10388
* Experience collaborating with large research team, coordinating with members in multiple locations. 

**The Erdös Institute Data Science Boot Camp May 2021**
* Month long boot camp on data science and machine learning, including supervised learning algoirthms for regression and classification, forecasting for time series data, dimensionality reduction, and neural networks. 
* Completed a corporate sponsored project with three other participants called "ClassifyMyMeds: Predicting Prior Authorization Approval and Volume", which won 3rd place out of 50 teams.
